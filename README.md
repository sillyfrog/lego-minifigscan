# LEGOÂ® Minifig Scanner

This is the source code of a copy of the Minifig scanner from https://brickingaround.com/minifigscan/ - with a modification to allow the selection of the camera to use. It is hosted here: https://public.sillyfrog.com/lego-minifigscan/

I found on my iPhone that it took a while for it to focus on the bar code when it was close up, sometimes taking several seconds (and when standing in KMart next to the service desk it was a bit awkward). 

Using this version I can force the use of the "Back Ultra Wide Camera", which causes it to focus instantly and scan the barcode immediately.

Side note: I have since tried `omgbricks` app and it has a similar issue where it takes a while to focus on the barcode when it's up close.
